# Films API

Films API is a GraphQL API project I created recently. This project is just my learning process about APIs. It's nothing more than a simple API, but I had fun creating it. So, use this project also for your learning process.

## Requirements

In this project I use more than 5 (five) additional modules or packages, you can install them via https://pypi.org/ or go directly to the official website of each package.
